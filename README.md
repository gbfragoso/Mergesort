# Mergesort
Comparison between Haskell and Java implementations of mergesort

# Compilation
gcc -o seq sequencias.c (or run in some IDE)

# Running
1. Generate some amount of samples with sequencias.c (./seq)
2. Run programs:
  * Open the mergesortN.hs (for sampleN.txt in your case we only use 4 samples) and then run "main".
  * Import mergesort.zip to NetBeans, points to file on line 22 and then run.
